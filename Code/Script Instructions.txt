- We have used a github library in our code - https://github.com/mayukh18/reco
- However, as this library was old, we had to modify a few modules to run our code - svd_updated2.py and utils.py
- We have included these updated py files along with our main code
- Keep the svd_updated2.py and utils.py files in the same folder as the main ipynb code
